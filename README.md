In any level of education, a good majority of time spent studying can be attributed to organizing the study material into an interpretable format. There exist many studies that show that compartmentalization of information can drastically improve one’s information recall and overall efficiency while studying.

Knowledge_Net implements a way to automatically organizes pre-existing study material in order to enhance studying performance by creating a meaningful visualization that indicates the user’s strengths and weaknesses in a particular subject.
