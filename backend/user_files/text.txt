Diffusion	The passive movement of particles from an area of high concentration to low concentration. This happens along a concentration gradient
Osmosis	A passive movement of water molecules through a semi permeable membrane. Water moves from an area of low solute concentration to high solute concentration
Active Transport	An active movement where an input of energy is required. Particles move from low concentration to high concentration
Facilitated Diffusion	A passive movement of particles from high to low concentration through a protein channel in a cell.
Isotonic Solution	The same concentration of dissolved substances. Water in = water out.
Hypertonic Solution	Higher concentration of solutes outside cell than inside
Plasmolyse	When a cell has shrunk
Hypotonic Solution	A cell has more solute inside than outside.
Turgid	Cell may explode under pressure due to a hypotonic solution.
Exocytosis	Movement out of a cell
